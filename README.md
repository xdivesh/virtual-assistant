"Hello!  I would like to present my virtual assistant project written in C++. The purpose of this program is to greet users based on the time of day, respond to various commands, and perform actions like opening applications."

Key Functions:

wishme Function: "The wishme function checks the current time and greets the user accordingly. It uses the time library to get the system time and conditional statements to determine if it's morning, afternoon, or evening. It also uses the espeak command-line tool to provide audio greetings."

datetime Function: "The datetime function displays the current date and time. It converts the current time to a readable format using the ctime function."

main Function: "The main function is where the execution begins. First, it clears the console and displays a welcome message. Then it prompts the user for a password. If the correct password is entered, the program continues; otherwise, it keeps asking until the right password is provided. After authentication, it listens for user commands."
